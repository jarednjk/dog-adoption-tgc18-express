Strategy

User of my website are people are generally dog lovers who are either current dog owners or future dog owners. Current dog owners might put their pet up for adoption for certain reasons. Future dog owners may prefer to adopt instead of buy as there is no upfront cost to buy them as well as other reasons. However, they also want important information to see if the dog is healthy and a good fit for their criterias.

My users may not be able to find all the critical information such as hdb approved, hypoallergenic, and health status. I also noticed that certain pet adoption websites are too complicated, making it difficult for the users to navigate to browse the dogs available for adoption.

Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog or cat, and rightly so, there are many benefits to adopting a pet. Pet adoption fees are usually much lower than buying from a breeder. You’re also likely to find a pet who’s already learned a few things. Adoptable pets are often already housetrained, good with kids, and do well with other pets. And don’t forget the wonderful feeling you get from saving a life!
